Typewriter
==========

This plugin provides typewriter scrolling -- Ã  la _iA Writer_, _WriteRoom_ and other distraction-free editors --  for Sublime Text 2 & 3.

Toggle "typewriter mode" via:

- The command palette (search for `typewriter`).
- The `typewriter_mode` setting in settings & keymap files. (See examples provided.) 

**Please note** that while "typewriter mode" is enabled using the mouse is very difficult (apart from scrolling, I find).

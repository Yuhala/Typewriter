Typewriter
==========

This plugin provides typewriter scrolling -- Ã  la _iA Writer_, _WriteRoom_ and other distraction-free editors --  for Sublime Text 2 & 3.

## Installation

You can install Typewriter either manually or through _Package Control_. The latter is preferred as it will update automatically.

### Package Control

Typewriter is not available in _Package Control_ by default, you will need to add it first

1. Select the `Package Control: Add Repository` command via the palette and add this repository: `https://github.com/alehandrof/Typewriter`
2. Select the `Package Control: Install Package` command via the palette and choose the newly-available `Typewriter`.

### Manually

Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/alehandrof/Typewriter.git`) in your Packages folder.

## Usage

Toggle "typewriter mode" via:

- The command palette (search for `typewriter`).
- The `typewriter_mode` setting in settings & keymap files. (See examples provided.) 

**Please note** that while "typewriter mode" is enabled using the mouse is very difficult (apart from scrolling, I find).
